# Travel Destinations

A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit.

## Introduction

This simple travel page came to be as I worked on the `Git & Github` extracurricular course in the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Getting Started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/frankolson/course-collaboration-travel-plans.git
cd course-collaboration-travel-plans
```

Then open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
